The initial design for this part comes from a `2" Black LDPE FP-321 Square Tubing Finishing Plug` manufactured by Caplugs. I could have just bought one from ![Fastenal for $0.39 USD](https://www.fastenal.com/products/details/11130986), but wanted to improve my modeling skills so I 3D printed it. Design is multi-use and fully parametric.

Recommended settings for 3D Printing
* Layer height: <= 0.2mm
* Material:
    * Mostly rigid with just a little bit of flex
    * Completely watertight such as [Bridge Nylon from Taulman](https://taulman3d.com/bridge-nylon.html)
    * Dyed black using some [Rit All-Purpose Powder Dye](https://www.ritdye.com/color-library/core-colors/)
* Adhesion: due to the parts small size any lifting can be countered by enabling brim
