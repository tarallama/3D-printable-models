This part is called `2" Black LDPE FP-321 Square Tubing Finishing Plug`. I could have just bought one from ![Fastenal for $0.39 USD](https://www.fastenal.com/products/details/11130986), but wanted to improve my modeling skills so I 3D printed it.

Recommended settings for 3D Printing:
* Layer height: <= 0.2mm 
* Material:
    * Something that is ridig and watertight
