# Notes
This part is an internal locking component which allows for extension/collapse of a hiking pole. During transportation this part was lost rendering the poles useless. I could not source a replacement part as this style of pole is no longer manufactured or sold. 3D Printing to the rescue!

# Recommended settings for 3D Printing:
* Orientation: Vertical with threads furthest away from the print surface
* Layer height: <= 0.15mm 
* Material:
    * Must be slightly flexible
    * Surface must not be too slippery
    * I settled on a Nylon called Taulman Bridge
