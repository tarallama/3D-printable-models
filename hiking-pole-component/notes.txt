During transportation a component of one of my hiking poles was lost. The poles are no longer manufactured and replacement parts cannot be sourced. 3D Printing comes to the rescue!

The part is an internal locking component which allows for extension/collapse of the pole. Design was reverse engineered from an original using calipers and OpenSCAD.

Recommended settings for 3D Printing:
* Orientation: Vertical with threads furthest away from the print surface
* Layer height: <= 0.15mm 
* Material:
    * Must be slightly flexible
    * Surface must not be too slippery
    * I settled on a Nylon called Taulman Bridge
