# Notes
This is a privacy blocker to be installed over the top of a small external webcam. Remodel of one of my old designs (https://www.youmagine.com/designs/webcam-top-hat) but now more easily customized. Doesn't block your microphone, but better than nothing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Recommended settings for 3D Printing:
* Support: not needed
* Material: something that looks cool
